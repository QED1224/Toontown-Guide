# Contributing to the TTRSG

Interested in contributing to the TTRSG? Great&mdash;we welcome contributions
of any kind (typo fixes, corrections, new content, etc).

## Getting Started

The TTRSG is built with [mdBook][1] and linted with [Vale][2]. While neither
tool is strictly required for contributing, you'll likely want to install both
if plan on committing non-trivial work.
