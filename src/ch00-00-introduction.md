# Introduction

> **Heads up**: Looking for the old, TTO-focused guide? You can still [find it
> here][OLD].

The TTRSG (or *Toontown Rewritten Strategy Guide*) is a comprehensive,
strategy-oriented guide for [Toontown Rewritten][TTR]. It aims to be a
compliment to more general resources, such as the
[Toontown Rewritten Wiki][TTRW], and is a spiritual successor to the
[Toontown-Resources][OLD] guide.
